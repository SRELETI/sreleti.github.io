## GNU/Linux

The goal of the GNU project is to promote `free software`. `Richard Stallman` started the project. By free software, he means `freedom for users`. He describes four things

* A user should be able to freely use the software for whatever purpose he wants.
* A user should be able to modify the program to suite his/her needs.
* A user should have the freedom to redistribute the software copies.
* A user should be able to distribute modified versions of the software.

He felt that the first thing to do to promote free software is to develop a free operating system. The first software package developed as a part of it is `GNU Emacs`. Some other packages developed were `GCC compiler`, `GNOME` and so-on. The kernel used was Linux kernel developed by linus torvalds. So, the operating system is called as `GNU/Linux`. All the linux distros are based from `GNU/Linux`. However, only some distros are treated by the GNU project as `GNU/Linux` distros. [Here](https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html) is the list of `GNU/Linux` distros. The most popular linux distros are not endorsed by GNU because of mainly two reasons.

* The distros dont have a policy of only including free software and remove non-free software if it is discovered.
* The kernel they distribute contains only blobs and no source code.
