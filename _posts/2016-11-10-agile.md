## Agile Manifesto

Agile methodologies and principles are based on `Agile Manifesto`. The `Agile Manifesto` has `four core values` and `twelve principles`.

* http://agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/manifesto.html

## How agile principles/practices can be implemented in a project?

* A process can be used to apply `agile principles` in a project. A process divided the work in a project into different phases. The phases are divided into activites and activites are further divided into tasks, where the actual work is done.
