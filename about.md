I'm Sudeep Reddy Eleti, a software developer in Toronto. I'm responsible for everything on this site. This is *Sudeep on Software*, where I will be talking about Software development.


For my day job, I'm a software developer at IBM, working on developing a [multi-tenant Spark service](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/apache-spark/) on Bluemix cloud platform.
